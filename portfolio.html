    <div class="about-me-text">
      <p>Hi, I'm Grayson, born and raised in Wisconsin. I graduated from CVTC with an associate's degree in software development. I've always loved technology so this only made sense to me. I now have a job in IT and I've been enjoying it so far.
      </p>

      <p>If I'm not at work or working on any coding projects, I'm spending time with my wife, playing video games, or watching YouTube.</p>
      
      <p>I've been trying to keep up with some coding projects to keep my skills sharp and hopefully land a programming job. If you're interested in hiring or interviewing me, don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
