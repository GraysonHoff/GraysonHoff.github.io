            <p>this is a website that I made with some of my classmates for a capstone project in school. (might take a minute to load)</p>

            <p>this is a website that I made for myself and for others to see. I wanted to keep it pretty lightweight and minimal because that's the kind of style I really like for personal websites like these.</p>

            <h3>Raspberry Pi 5 NAS</h3>
            <hr class="line-breaker">
            <p>this is a project i want to work on just so i can have a centralized place for my storage and not have to use any external drives or cloud service for everything. i also like the idea of accessing family photos from any device connected to the network.</p>
            <br>
            <p>i have also wanted to build something with a pi 5 so this felt like a practical project to work on.</p>
